                <h3>My Schooling</h3>
        
        <hr>
                <p>I went to KIPP Academy Lynn for my wholr middle school career.</p>
                <p>I also attend KIPP Academy Lynn Collegiate for my whole four years of my highschool career.</p>
                <p>What had brought me to NEIT was the brochure that was sent to my house.</p>
                <p>The brochure made me take an interest on the school because of the different trades and programs they were advertising.</p>
                <p>The biggest porgram that had stood out to me was the cyber security program on the brochure.</p>
                <p>I am currently trying to get my Bachelor degree in cyber security.</p>
